			<h2>FREQUENT QUESTIONS</h2>
			<hr>
			<p class="subtext">To help you get going faster, let's get some of these common questions out of the way. If you're still not sure about something, feel free to ask us anytime.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Any other destinations?</h4>
					<p>Each year we select up to 12 unique locations, explore each spot and bring back the best possible trip on the market for our travelers. If you are interested in having our team source a new location or have a destination tip of your own, we'd love to hear from you!</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Is my trip insured?</h4>
					<p>Absolutely! We are traveler's ourselves and never like to be stuck out in the rain, left without a place to go. Our trips are insured with you and mind. Talk with one of our dedicated agents to learn more.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Do you really handle it all?</h4>
					<p>That's one of the key features about our trips. Every detail from transportation to meals and adventures is taken care of and our customer service team is available 24/7/365 to help. Anything at all, just give us a call: 888.YUL.SRVC.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>How many people can I book?</h4>
					<p>The more the merrier. Our destinations can accommodate as many as 9 guests per group. Want to book for more than 9? Maybe a wedding or event? No problem, our agents can help with all the planning.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>What if I have to cancel?</h4>
					<p>No worries, we understand life happens. If for any reason you need to cancel your trip, we only ask that you give us 3 days notice. If you'd like to reschedule, we can make that happen too. The easiest way to reschedule is to call 888.YUL.SRVC and speak with a scheduling agent.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Are you hiring?</h4>
					<p>YUL is always expanding and although we are currently not hiring, that doesn't mean we won't need your help in the future. Please submit your resume to: info@yul.com.</p>
